# The Darkwater Park
Story, Game Design and Game programmed by **Koyya Vishnu Teja**

It is an interactive fiction game or text adventure game or text-based adventure game. Entirely based on the player's imagination, the game takes you deeper into the story based on the player's commands. Based on the text or the input given by the player, the story progresses. For a better game experience, these games contain background soundtracks.

In this game, the player will not find any elements of CGI or graphical animations. It's just a display of a storyline and a text input box for the command input. The game appears to be like a command-line interface.

The Darkwater Park, is an interactive fiction game. It works on browsers, as the game is created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
